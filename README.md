# SoundGarden's Collab Warz — Frontend

A small React frontend using the same visual language as your other site.  
This app provides two main tabs: "Current" and "History", and uses a simple tab router.

To run:
1. npm install
2. npm run dev

This is a starter scaffold — extend it with your API calls and components as needed.
